# Loopback Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

---
## _Install Application_
---

1.  Ensure Node.js is installed on machine that can access both the target and the source.  You can download and follow instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2.  Clone this repo onto on machine that can access both the target and the source locations.
3.	In the root folder of the repo install all dependencies by running a npm install command at a command prompt.
	> **npm install**

---
## _Configure Application_
---
4.	Identify source and target instances based on requirements and add these to the /server/datasources file, using existing files as templates.
	For information on data source connectors, see [Loopback data sources](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Defining-data-sources.html).
	To [store credentials](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Defining-data-sources.html#specifying-database-credentials-with-environment-variables) securely use [environment variables](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Environment-specific-configuration.html#data-source-configuration).
5.	Identify data to be transferred i.e. what table are we interested in transferring
6.	Define model for source and target tables.  There are 2 means to do this:
	-	By running the discover process while will automatically create a JSON file in the /common/models folder as well as a stub of JS file.  The ‘discover’ scripts can be found in the /server/bin folder under the project root.
	- 	Manually creating the JSON and JS files in the /common/models folder.
7.	Include the new model(s) in the model-config, so that they appear in the Loopback explorer ensuring to make relevant models ‘public’.  Those models specified as public in model-config.json ensure that only those models that are of interest to the customer are available

---
## _Run Application_
---
8.	In the root of the repo run a node . command to start the loopback server
	> **node .**
9.	The loopback explorer is now available to you through a browser and you should be able to access all the out-of-the-box apis as well as any customer APIs added.  Use the ‘moveAllData’ api to move data from source to target.  This api is a customised api.
	> **[MyApp](http://localhost:3000/explorer)**
10.	Benchmark data transfer activity with a view to provide customer with a time to implement as well as determining the optimal chunk size for data transfer
11.	Plan transfers accordingly
12.	Transfer Data!
